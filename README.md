# AI Usage Policy

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) as a **learning and productivity aid**, not as a replacement for understanding or decision-making.

## How AI is Used

AI tools may be used for:

- Generating initial scaffolding or boilerplate code
- Explaining unfamiliar APIs, language features, or patterns
- Suggesting alternative implementations or refactors
- Helping reason through bugs or edge cases
- Improving code readability and structure

## How AI is _Not_ Used

AI tools are **not** used to:

- Blindly copy and paste code without understanding it
- Bypass learning core concepts relevant to the project
- Replace architectural decisions or problem-solving
- Submit code I cannot explain, debug, or modify

## Responsibility & Understanding

For any AI-assisted code included in this project:

- I review the code line-by-line
- I can explain _why_ it exists and _how_ it works
- I adapt naming, structure, or logic to match my own mental model
- I am able to extend, refactor, or debug the code independently

## Learning Philosophy

AI is treated as:

- A **force multiplier**, not a crutch
- A faster way to learn industry patterns and best practices
- A tool to reduce time spent on mechanical work so more time can be spent on understanding systems, tradeoffs, and design decisions

This approach reflects how modern development teams operate, while maintaining personal accountability for the quality, correctness, and maintainability of the code.

## TL;DR

> This project uses AI tools responsibly for learning and productivity. All AI-assisted code is reviewed, understood, and modifiable by me. I use AI to move faster—not to avoid understanding.
